# Getting Started

## Review Learn Build Tools

This production involves updating our existing Learn Build Tools content, which is currently a part of our [Front End Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) inside of Advanced Web Development (Section 21)

The existing Learn Build Tools content consists of the following external articles:

- [What Build Tools Can Do For You](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-learn-build-tools/articles/fecp-external-what-build-tools-can-do-for-you)
- [Comparison of Build Tools](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-learn-build-tools/articles/fecp-external-comparison-of-build-tools)
- [Webpack Boilerplate](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-learn-build-tools/external_resources/fecp-external-webpack-boilerplate)
- [The Many Jobs of JS Build Tools](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-learn-build-tools/articles/fecp-external-the-many-jobs-of-js-build-tools)
- [How to Keep Your Javascript Libraries Up to Date](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-advanced-web-development/modules/fecp-learn-build-tools/articles/fecp-external-how-to-keep-your-javascript-libraries-up-to-date)

If you have some extra time, it would also be good to briefly look through these articles.

## Review Updated Syllabus

After reading the existing content course, please take some time to review the [updated syllabus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16uUhZgXrd9I2C17s-rV7TQjxL1sFDTuCS7Gzs_fsuKk/edit#gid=224373848) for the new Learn Build Tools course.

We will be creating a new standalone course about Build Tools that will be inserted into the Career Pathways. This will require the creation of new articles, quizzes, projects, and lessons.

## Review the Workflow Document

Next, please go through the [workflow document](workflow.md) to set up the Github repo and get familiar with the tools that we will use during production.
